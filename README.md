# Movie site

## Description
This site displays a list of movies with relevant information and displays a trailer of the movie when a user clicks on it.

## Prerequisites

Requires atleast [Python 2.7.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/)

## Instalation and usage

The project can be downloaded here - https://github.com/janist7/udacity-movie-site

The webpage is started by opening index.html, if no index.html file is present then it should be generated by running entertainment_center.py, that will generate the html file with content from movies.json.

## Structure

Python files are located in the folder - python
Template files are located in folder - python/templates
Movies are located in a file called movies.json that is in - python/movies.

## Future plans

An idea was to write code to add new movies from webpage that updates movies.json with the new movie, but getting data from input form to a .py file requires rewriting of the templates/code to make it into a web app using [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)( will look at other options too).

Tried using native [cgi](https://docs.python.org/2/library/cgi.html) methods but that requires a python cgi capable server and rewriting of templates/code, but flask seems a better alternative.

Im also thinging of integrating the second project (portfolio) into this one.
