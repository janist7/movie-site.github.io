                     ### Description ###
The webpage is started by opening index.html, if no index.htnl file is present then it should be generated by running entertainment_center.py, that wil generate the html file with content from movies.json.

                      ### Structure ###
Python files are located in the folder python
Template files are located in folder python/templates
Movies are located in a file called movies.json that is in python/movies.

                     ### Future plans ###
An idea was to add option to posibility to write new movies from webpage and update movies.json, but getting data from input form to a .py file requires a rewriting of the templates/code to make it into a web app using flask( will look at other options too).

Tried using natife cgi methods but that requires a python cgi server and rewriting of templates/code, but flask seems a better alternative.

Im also thinging of integrating the second project (portfolio) into this one.
